## Technical - Learnings

I have learnt a great deal through this project and the various projects we have made during our training. To sum up, I have learnt: 
-   Front-end Development using Angular: Using HTML, CSS and TypeScript, we have learnt creating different elements of a webpage.
-   Back-end Development using Angular: Using MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS, we have learnt how to create databases, schemas and connect the front-end to the back-end. 
-   Authorisation and Authentication techniques using JSON Web Tokens, Local Storage and bcrypt.
